# Voluntary Product Accessibility Template (VPAT)

This repository contains Voluntary Product Accessibility Template&reg; (VPAT&reg;) documents outlining Section 508 accessibility information for Springer Nature products.

The purpose of the VPAT is to assist U.S. Federal contracting officials and other buyers in making preliminary assessments regarding the availability of commercial “Electronic and Information Technology” products and services with features that support accessibility.  It is assumed and recommended that offerers will provide additional contact information to facilitate more detailed inquiries.

The first table of the Template provides a summary view of the Section 508 Standards.  The subsequent tables provide more detailed views of each subsection.

There are three columns in each table.  The first column of the Summary Table describes the subsections of subparts B and C of the Standards.  The second describes the supporting features of the product or refers you to the corresponding detailed table, e.g. “equivalent facilitation”.  The third contains any additional remarks and explanations regarding the product.

In the subsequent tables, the first column contains the lettered paragraphs of the subsections.  The second column describes the supporting features of the product with regard to that paragraph.  The third column contains any additional remarks and explanations regarding the product.

## Creating a new VPAT

To create a new VPAT for a product, use a *copy* of the [base template](./base-template.md) as a starting point. Ensure that you update the following placeholders within your copied template:

- !INSERT PRODUCT!
- !INSERT DATE!
- !INSERT EMAIL!

then add your product to the list below.
