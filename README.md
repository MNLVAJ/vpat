# Voluntary Product Accessibility Template (VPAT)

This repository contains Voluntary Product Accessibility Template&reg; (VPAT&reg;) documents for Springer Nature products.

The VPAT is a template used to document a product's conformance with accessibility standards and guidelines. The purpose of the VPAT is to assist customers and buyers in making preliminary assessments regarding the availability of commercial "Electronic and Information Technology", also referred to as "Information and Communication Technology" (ICT) products and services with features that support accessibility.

### VPATÂ® Version 2.2 (July 2018)

New documents in this repository should conform to VPAT version 2.2, which has been updated to cover changes to Section 508 that were finalized and published in 2017, commonly known as the "Section 508 Refresh", which incorporates the [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.0](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/) (WCAG 2.0 or ISO/IEC 40500) by reference. VPAT 2.0 also can be used to report against WCAG 2.0 and the European standard [EN 301 549](http://mandate376.standards.eu/standard).

It includes the following standards/guidelines:

* Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.0, at [http://www.w3.org/TR/2008/REC-WCAG20-20081211/](http://www.w3.org/TR/2008/REC-WCAG20-20081211/)
* [Revised Section 508 standards](https://www.access-board.gov/guidelines-and-standards/communications-and-it/about-the-ict-refresh/final-rule/text-of-the-standards-and-guidelines) as published by the U.S. Access Board in the Federal Register on January 18, 2017, including the [Corrections to the ICT Final Rule](https://www.access-board.gov/guidelines-and-standards/communications-and-it/about-the-ict-refresh/corrections-to-the-ict-final-rule) as published by the US Access Board in the Federal Register on January 22, 2018
* EN 301 549  Accessibility requirements suitable for public procurement of ICT products and services in Europe, - V1.1.2 (2015-04) at [http://mandate376.standards.eu/standard](http://mandate376.standards.eu/standard)

> Existing documents may show conformance with VPAT 1.0. We expect these to be updated to VPAT 2.2 by Q1 2019.

## Creating a new VPAT

- !INSERT PRODUCT!
- !INSERT PRODUCT NAME & VERSION NUMBER!  
- !INSERT PRODUCT DESCRIPTION!
